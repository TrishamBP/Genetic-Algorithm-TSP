# Genetic-Algorithm-TSP-Genetic Algorithm for a Travelling Salesman Problem.In this article, a genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the travelling salesman problem. Genetic algorithms are heuristic search algorithms inspired by the process that supports the evolution of life. The algorithm is designed to replicate the natural selection process to carry generation, i.e. survival of the fittest of beings.
